#' \pkg{CmdStanR}: the \R interface to CmdStan.
#'
#' @details CmdStanR (\pkg{cmdstanr} package) is a lightweight interface to Stan
#'   ([mc-stan.org](https://mc-stan.org)) for \R users. It provides the
#'   necessary objects and functions to compile a Stan program and run Stan's
#'   algorithms from \R via CmdStan, the shell interface to Stan
#'   ([mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan)).
#'
#' @section Getting started: CmdStanR requires a working version of CmdStan. If
#'   you already have CmdStan installed see [cmdstan_model()] to get
#'   started, otherwise see [install_cmdstan()] for help with installation.
#'
#' @section Comparison with RStan: The RStan interface (\pkg{rstan} package) is
#'   an in-memory interface to Stan and relies on \R packages like \pkg{Rcpp}
#'   and \pkg{inline} to call C++ code from R. On the other hand, the \R code in
#'   this package does not directly call any C++ code, instead relying on
#'   CmdStan for compilation, running algorithms, and writing results to output
#'   files.
#'
#'   Both forms of interfacing with Stan have advantages and disadvantages. An
#'   in-memory interface like RStan is able to offer more advanced features than
#'   CmdStanR (for example the `rstan::log_prob()` and `rstan::grad_log_prob()`
#'   methods) but keeping up with Stan releases is more complicated for RStan,
#'   often requiring non-trivial changes to the \pkg{rstan} package and always
#'   requiring new CRAN releases of \pkg{rstan} and \pkg{StanHeaders}. With
#'   CmdStanR, the latest features in Stan will be available from \R immediately
#'   after updating CmdStan, which can be done with the [install_cmdstan()]
#'   function. We also anticipate that running Stan via external processes will 
#'   have the advantage of playing nicer with R (and RStudio) and result in fewer 
#'   unexpected crashes than when using RStan.
#'
#'   Another difference between RStan and CmdStanR is the license. RStan is
#'   GPL-3 while the license for CmdStanR (like Stan) is BSD-3, which is a bit
#'   more permissive.
